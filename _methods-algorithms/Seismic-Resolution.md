excerpt: "Seismic resolution and fidelity are the two important measures of the quality of the seismic record and the seismic images. Seismic resolution quantifies the level of precision, such as the finest size of the subsurface objects detectable by the seismic data whereas the seismic fidelity quantifies the truthfulness such as the genuineness of the data or the level to which the imaged target position matches its true subsurface position."
